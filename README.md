# Fuzzy_Logic_on_Glucose_Control  
This project implement the "Active Insulin Infusion Using Fuzzy-Based Closed-loop Control".  
All of the file need save in same folder when execcute the simulate.  
Fuzzy_type1_sgn and fuzzy_type1_final have the same feature. 
The sgn file is use the sgn function to simulate the diabetic patient and the "final" file is base on the
"Identifier based intelligent blood glucose concentration regulation for type 1 diabetic patients: An adaptive fuzzy approach".
